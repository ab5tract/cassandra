Casuistry

WHAT
  Casuistry is to CSS as Markaby is to XHTML: a tool for generating CSS using pure Ruby.  Style declarations in Casuistry are made in Ruby code, as opposed to a parsed DSL.  Casuistry lets you use variables and define helper methods to simplify the development of stylesheets.

WHY
  CSS does not have variables.  CSS does not have selector nesting.  CSS is not Turing-complete.  Search-and-replace is not good enough.  

How

  Similarly to Markaby, methods representing tag, class, or id selectors take blocks, and you define your CSS properties inside the blocks.  Nested blocks indicate child selectors.
